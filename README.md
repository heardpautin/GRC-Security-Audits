# 🏗️ Automated GRC Compliance Checks  
### Checkov-Driven Mapping for NIST, CIS, and ISO 27001

A framework designed to streamline **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** checks for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configurations using **Checkov**, with clear and actionable reporting mapped directly to major compliance standards.

---

## 🚧 Project Status: Under Development

This project is in the **initial development and configuration phase**.

- Compliance mapping files are being drafted.  
- The reporting engine (`generate_report.py`) is in progress.  
- Contributions and feedback are welcome during this early stage.

---

## 🌟 Project Goals & Roadmap

### ✔️ Automated IaC Scanning  
Use **Checkov** to scan Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, serverless, and other IaC frameworks.

### ✔️ Compliance Mapping  
Translate Checkov findings to major GRC frameworks, including:

- **NIST SP 800-53 / CSF**  
- **CIS Benchmarks**  
- **ISO/IEC 27001**

### ✔️ Actionable GRC Reports  
Generate readable compliance reports that:

- Identify misconfigurations  
- Cite the exact violated control  
- Provide remediation guidance (planned)  

### ✔️ CI/CD Integration  
Designed for integration with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, and more.
