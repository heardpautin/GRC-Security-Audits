## 🏗️ Project Readme: Automated GRC Compliance Checks

### Automated GRC Compliance: Checkov Integration for NIST, CIS, and ISO 27001

A framework designed to streamline and automate **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** checks for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configurations using **Checkov**, providing clear, actionable reporting mapped directly to major compliance standards. 

---

## 🚧 Status: Project Under Development

**Please Note:** This project is currently in the **initial development and configuration phase.**

* The core concept is defined, but the **compliance mapping files** are still being populated.
* The reporting script (`generate_report.py`) is being written and tested.
* Contributions and feedback on the mapping logic are welcome even at this early stage!

---

## 🌟 Goals and Future Features

* **Automated Scanning:** Integrate **Checkov** to automatically scan common IaC frameworks (Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, etc.) for security and compliance misconfigurations.
* **Compliance Mapping:** Develop a robust layer to translate Checkov findings directly to relevant controls in:
    * **NIST SP 800-53/CSF**
    * **CIS Benchmarks**
    * **ISO/IEC 27001**
* **Actionable Reports:** Generate human-readable reports that highlight non-compliant resources and clearly state the specific GRC control violated.
* **CI/CD Integration Ready:** Design for easy integration into any Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Once fully developed, you will need the following installed:

* **Python** (3.8+)
* **pip** (Python package installer)
* **Checkov** (Can be installed via pip)
    ```bash
